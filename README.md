# socket-conductor

This a broswer based conducting animation. It is a work in progress and designed
to replace [this
version](https://github.com/danieljamesross/node-ws-max-conductor) which relies
on high frame rates and doesn't support multiple clients. Nope. Bad programming,
Dan! This one uses vectors and [socket.io](https://socket.io/index.html).

## TODO
- MaxMSP compatibility.
- Text display (BPM, beat, time sig, etc.).
- Function to allow resizing.
- Make the Vector lines curve nicely.
- Metronome audio.
- Message firing to say exactly when the conducting ball has reached its
  destination.
  - Trails.
  
## HELP
As ever, if you want to help, please do. Raise an issue and hit me up!
